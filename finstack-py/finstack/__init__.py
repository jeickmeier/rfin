"""Finstack: Python bindings for the Rust finstack quantitative-finance toolkit.

The public API mirrors the Rust umbrella crate structure exactly.
Import subpackages by domain::

    from finstack import core, analytics, valuations

Submodules are loaded lazily — importing ``finstack`` does not pull in every
domain, which reduces cold-start time in CLIs, notebooks, and serverless
contexts.
