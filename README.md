# Finstack

Finstack is a Rust-first quantitative finance workspace with Python and
WebAssembly bindings. The repository is organized around reusable financial
primitives, pricing and risk engines, statement modeling, deterministic
scenario tooling, portfolio analytics, and thin binding layers that keep the
business logic in Rust.

## Library Map

- `finstack-core`: currencies, money, rates, dates, calendars, market data,
  cashflow primitives, math utilities, and the expression engine.
- `finstack-cashflows`: schedule construction, accrual logic, and
  currency-preserving cashflow aggregation for bonds, loans, swaps, and
  structured products.
- `finstack-analytics`: return-series performance analytics, drawdown analysis,
  tail risk, benchmark-relative metrics, and rolling statistics.
- `finstack-monte-carlo`: generic Monte Carlo engine, stochastic processes,
  discretizations, payoffs, variance reduction, and result types.
- `finstack-margin`: CSA and repo margin specs, VM/IM engines, SIMM helpers,
  collateral eligibility, and XVA primitives.
- `finstack-statements`: period-based financial statement modeling,
  forecasting, formula evaluation, and extension hooks.
- `finstack-statements-analytics`: higher-level analysis on top of
  `finstack-statements`, including scenarios, variance tooling, templates,
  reporting, and covenant-oriented workflows.
- `finstack-valuations`: instrument coverage across rates, credit, equity, FX,
  structured products, and private markets, plus pricing, metrics,
  attribution, covenants, and calibration.
- `finstack-portfolio`: entity and position containers, aggregation, grouping,
  selective repricing, factor decomposition, optimization, and scenario-aware
  workflows.
- `finstack-scenarios`: deterministic scenario composition, market-data and
  statement shocks, instrument shocks, and time roll-forward workflows.

## Umbrella Crate

The top-level Rust crate is `finstack`, which re-exports every sub-crate so
downstream consumers reach the full API through a single dependency.

```toml
[dependencies]
finstack = { path = "finstack" }
```

One pass-through feature remains to gate heavy compile-time cost:

- `mc` — enables `finstack-monte-carlo`/`margin`/`valuations` Monte Carlo paths
  (pulls in `nalgebra`).

`finstack-cashflows` is a standalone workspace crate and a direct dependency of
`finstack-valuations`.

## Python Bindings

`finstack-py` builds the Python package named `finstack`. The binding tree
mirrors the Rust domain layout and currently exposes these top-level
subpackages:

- `analytics`
- `core`
- `correlation`
- `margin`
- `monte_carlo`
- `portfolio`
- `scenarios`
- `statements`
- `statements_analytics`
- `valuations`

The Python examples and notebook curriculum live under `finstack-py/examples/`.
The notebook runner is `finstack-py/examples/run_all_notebooks.py`.

## WASM Bindings

`finstack-wasm` builds the `finstack-wasm` package for browser and Node.js
consumers. It exposes namespaced modules that mirror the Rust workspace:

- `core`
- `analytics`
- `correlation`
- `margin`
- `monte_carlo`
- `portfolio`
- `scenarios`
- `statements`
- `statements_analytics`
- `valuations`

The package facade lives in `finstack-wasm/index.js`, TypeScript declarations
live in `finstack-wasm/index.d.ts`, and the namespace shims live in
`finstack-wasm/exports/`.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

The repository uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as the single source of truth for
toolchain versions (Rust, Python, Node, uv, wasm-pack, cargo-nextest, cargo-deny,
cargo-llvm-cov, maturin) and developer tasks.

```bash
# Install mise (macOS / Linux)
curl https://mise.run | sh

# Provision every pinned tool listed in mise.toml
mise install
```

> **Windows users:** run `mise run <task>` from a POSIX shell such as Git Bash,
> MSYS2, or WSL. mise itself works natively on Windows, and every task in
> `mise.toml` is cross-platform except `docs-all` (which shells out to a bash
> script under `scripts/`).

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustfin/rfin.git
cd rfin
mise install

mise run rust-build
mise run all-test
mise run python-build
mise run wasm-pkg
```

Run `mise tasks` to list every available task.
