# Production Release Preparation

## Quick start

When preparing a release, execute each phase in order. Copy the master checklist and track progress:

```
Release Prep Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Dead code audit
- [ ] Phase 2: Deprecated code removal
- [ ] Phase 3: Documentation audit
- [ ] Phase 4: Semver & breaking change analysis
- [ ] Phase 5: Performance regression check
- [ ] Phase 6: Release hygiene
- [ ] Phase 7: Final verification & tagging
```

After each phase, run `make ci-test` to confirm nothing is broken before proceeding.

## Phase 1: Dead code audit

Find and remove code that is never called, never compiled, or unreachable.

### 1a. Compiler-level dead code (all components)

**Rust** - Run these sequentially and fix each batch:

```bash
# Unused imports, variables, functions (compiler warnings)
cargo build --workspace 2>&1 | grep -E "warning.*unused|warning.*dead_code|warning.*unreachable"

# Unreachable pub items — items marked pub but never used outside the crate
cargo build --workspace 2>&1 | grep "never used\|never read"
```

**Python** - Check for unused imports and variables:

```bash
uv run ruff check finstack-py --select F401,F841 --no-fix
```

**TypeScript/UI** - Unused exports and variables:

```bash
cd finstack-ui && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -i "declared but"
```

### 1b. Deep dead code detection

Search for patterns that compilers miss:

1. **Pub items with zero external callers**: Search for `pub fn`, `pub struct`, `pub enum` in library crates and grep for their usage across the workspace. If no call site exists outside tests, either make private or remove.

2. **Feature-gated dead code**: Check `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` blocks — verify the features are actually used in `Cargo.toml` or by downstream crates.

3. **Test-only helpers leaked into lib**: Items in `src/` used only by `tests/` should be behind `#[cfg(test)]` or `#[cfg(feature = "test-utils")]`.

4. **Commented-out code**: Search for large blocks of commented code (`// ...` spanning 5+ lines). Remove — git has history.

5. **TODO/FIXME/HACK markers**: Audit all `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` comments. Resolve or file issues for each.

```bash
rg -n "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" --type rust --type python --type ts -g '!target/' -g '!node_modules/'
```

### 1c. Unused dependencies

```bash
# Rust — find deps declared but not imported
cargo install cargo-machete 2>/dev/null; cargo machete

# Python — check for unused requirements
uv run ruff check finstack-py --select F401

# UI
cd finstack-ui && npx depcheck
```

### Severity guide

- **Remove immediately**: Unused imports, dead functions, commented-out code, unused deps.
- **Gate with cfg(test)**: Test-only helpers in lib code.
- **Evaluate**: Pub items with no callers — may be part of the public API contract.

## Phase 2: Deprecated code removal

### 2a. Find all deprecation markers

```bash
# Rust deprecated attributes
rg '#\[deprecated' --type rust -g '!target/' -l

# Rust deprecated doc comments
rg '@deprecated|DEPRECATED' --type rust -g '!target/'

# Python deprecation warnings
rg 'DeprecationWarning|deprecated|@deprecated' --type python -g '!__pycache__/'

# TypeScript
rg '@deprecated|deprecated' --type ts -g '!node_modules/'
```

### 2b. For each deprecated item

1. **Verify replacement exists**: The deprecation message should point to a canonical replacement. Confirm the replacement is implemented and tested.
2. **Find all internal call sites**: Grep for usage across the workspace. Migrate each call site to the replacement.
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add the removal to `[Unreleased] > Removed` with migration instructions.
4. **Update Python/WASM bindings**: If the deprecated Rust API was exposed via bindings, remove the binding too.
5. **Remove the deprecated code**: Delete the function/struct/method and its tests.

### 2c. Legacy code patterns to remove

Search for and eliminate:

- `_v2`, `_v3`, `_old`, `_legacy`, `_compat` suffixed items
- `#[allow(deprecated)]` suppressions — resolve the underlying deprecation
- Shim modules or compatibility layers from previous migrations
- Feature flags that gate old behavior (`legacy`, `compat`, `v1`)

```bash
rg '_v2|_v3|_old|_legacy|_compat|allow\(deprecated\)' --type rust -g '!target/'
```

## Phase 3: Documentation audit

### 3a. Public API documentation

Run the existing documentation reviewer for detailed coverage:

> For detailed API doc standards, see the [documentation-reviewer skill](../documentation-reviewer/SKILL.md).

Quick automated check:

```bash
# Rust — build docs and check for missing doc warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --exclude finstack-py --exclude finstack-wasm --no-deps 2>&1 | head -50

# Python — check stub completeness
uv run pyright --verifytypes finstack --ignoreexternal
```

### 3b. README and high-level docs

Verify these files are current and accurate:

| File | Check |
|------|-------|
| `README.md` | Badges, install instructions, quick start example, feature list |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | All changes since last release documented; `[Unreleased]` section populated |
| `docs/` | No stale/orphaned docs referencing removed APIs |
| Crate-level `README.md` | Each crate's README reflects current API |

### 3c. Examples

All examples must compile and produce correct output:

```bash
# Rust examples
make examples

# Python examples
make examples-python

# Check for examples referencing deprecated/removed APIs
rg -l 'deprecated_function_name' finstack/examples/ finstack-py/examples/
```

### 3d. Migration guides

If deprecated APIs were removed (Phase 2), ensure:

- `CHANGELOG.md` contains before/after code snippets
- Migration is straightforward (no multi-step workarounds)
- All combinations of old usage patterns are covered

## Phase 4: Semver & breaking change analysis

Determines the correct version bump (patch / minor / major).

### 4a. Run cargo-semver-checks locally

```bash
# Compare current branch against the last release tag
cargo install cargo-semver-checks --locked 2>/dev/null
cargo semver-checks check-release -p finstack-core --baseline-rev <last-release-tag>
```

If semver-checks reports breaking changes, the release must be a **major** bump. If new public API was added, at least **minor**. Otherwise **patch**.

### 4b. Manual breaking change review

Semver-checks catches type/signature changes but misses behavioral breaks. Also review:

- Default values that changed (e.g., strict mode on/off)
- Error conditions that changed (functions that now return `Err` where they previously returned `Ok`)
- Numerical precision changes in pricing (golden test drift)
- Removed or renamed feature flags

### 4c. Feature flag matrix

Verify the crate builds under key feature combinations:

```bash
# Default features only
cargo build --workspace --exclude finstack-py --exclude finstack-wasm

# All features
cargo build --workspace --exclude finstack-py --exclude finstack-wasm --all-features

# Key individual feature flags
cargo build -p finstack-valuations --features mc
cargo build -p finstack-valuations --features test-utils
```

## Phase 5: Performance regression check

### 5a. Run benchmarks against baseline

```bash
# If a saved baseline exists from the last release
make bench-compare

# Or run fresh and inspect absolute numbers
make bench-perf
```

### 5b. Review for regressions

Flag any benchmark that regressed >10% from the saved baseline. Common causes:
- New allocations in hot paths
- Changed interpolation algorithms
- Additional validation in pricing loops

### 5c. Numerical accuracy (golden tests)

For a quant library, pricing drift is a release blocker. Verify:

- Golden file tests pass (QuantLib parity tests, reference prices)
- Bootstrap calibration convergence unchanged
- Greeks finite-difference stability unchanged

```bash
# Run QuantLib parity and calibration tests specifically
cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'test(quantlib) | test(parity) | test(golden) | test(calibration)' --no-fail-fast
```

## Phase 6: Release hygiene

### 6a. Version and metadata

- [ ] `workspace.package.version` in root `Cargo.toml` bumped per Phase 4 analysis
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` header renamed to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- [ ] Python package version matches (`pyproject.toml` / `maturin` config)
- [ ] WASM package version matches (`package.json`)
- [ ] License headers present where required

### 6b. Dependency audits (comprehensive)

```bash
# cargo-deny: licenses, advisories, bans, and sources (uses deny.toml)
cargo deny check

# Security-specific audit
make audit

# Lint all components (no auto-fix — must pass clean)
make lint
```

### 6c. MSRV verification

Confirm the crate compiles on the declared minimum supported Rust version:

```bash
# rust-version = "1.90" declared in Cargo.toml
rustup run 1.90.0 cargo check --workspace --exclude finstack-py --exclude finstack-wasm
```

### 6d. Publish dry-run

Verify crate packaging is correct (metadata, included files, no missing deps):

```bash
cargo publish -p finstack-core --dry-run
```

### 6e. Lock file hygiene

- [ ] `uv.lock` is committed and up to date (`uv lock --check`)
- [ ] `package-lock.json` is committed and up to date (`cd finstack-ui && npm ci`)
- [ ] `Cargo.lock` is gitignored (library convention — correct)

### 6f. Binary size check

```bash
make size-all
```

Review for unexpected size regressions from the previous release.

### 6g. API parity

```bash
make list
```

Verify Python and WASM bindings expose all intended public APIs.

### 6h. Release notes

Create `RELEASE_NOTES_X.Y.Z.md` following the established template (see `RELEASE_NOTES_0.8.0.md`). Include:

- Executive summary and "who should upgrade"
- Breaking changes with migration code snippets
- New features and improvements
- Bug fixes
- Test/doc additions

## Phase 7: Final verification & tagging

### 7a. Full test suite

```bash
make test
```

### 7b. CI and quality gates

```bash
make ci-test
```

### 7c. Pre-release checklist

- [ ] `git status` is clean (all changes committed)
- [ ] CI pipeline passes on the branch
- [ ] No `#[allow(dead_code)]` or `#[allow(unused)]` suppressions added during cleanup
- [ ] No new `TODO`/`FIXME` comments introduced
- [ ] CHANGELOG is complete and reviewed
- [ ] Release notes written and reviewed
- [ ] Version numbers consistent across all components

### 7d. Tag and release

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create GitHub release (attaches release notes)
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "Finstack vX.Y.Z" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_X.Y.Z.md
```

### 7e. Post-release

- [ ] Save benchmark baseline for the new release: `make bench-baseline`
- [ ] Add new `[Unreleased]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Bump version to next dev pre-release if desired
