# Interest Rate Instrument Standards

## Term-Index / Legacy IRS

### Standard market conventions

| Currency | Float index | Day count (fixed) | Day count (float) | Frequency (fixed) | Frequency (float) | Bus day |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| USD | Term SOFR or legacy 3M LIBOR | 30/360 | ACT/360 | Semi-annual | Quarterly | NYC |
| EUR | 6M EURIBOR | 30/360 | ACT/360 | Annual | Semi-annual | TARGET |
| GBP | Legacy 6M GBP LIBOR | ACT/365F | ACT/365F | Semi-annual | Semi-annual | London |
| JPY | 6M TIBOR / JPY LIBOR legacy | ACT/365F | ACT/365F | Semi-annual | Semi-annual | Tokyo |
| CHF | Legacy CHF LIBOR or contract-specific term-rate fallback | 30/360 | ACT/360 | Annual | Semi-annual | Zurich |

This section is for term-index or legacy IRS templates, not the current generic G10 OIS market standard. For current benchmark swap conventions in USD/GBP/EUR risk systems, use the OIS section below unless the trade explicitly references a term index.

### Standard trade template

```
Vanilla IRS defaults:
- Effective date: T+2 (spot start)
- Roll convention: Modified Following
- End of month rule: True (if start is EOM, roll to EOM)
- Float leg: simple accrual off the underlying term index
- Stub: none for standard spot-start schedules; explicit broken-date rule if non-standard
- Notional: No exchange (single currency)
```

## Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS)

### Standard market conventions

| Currency | Overnight index | Float day count | Fixed-leg convention | Typical payment lag |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| USD | SOFR | ACT/360 | CCP / venue template; do not inherit vanilla IRS defaults | 2 business days common |
| EUR | ESTR | ACT/360 | CCP / venue template | 1-2 business days by template |
| GBP | SONIA | ACT/365F | CCP / venue template | Often 0 business days |
| JPY | TONAR | ACT/365F | CCP / venue template | Template-specific |
| CHF | SARON | ACT/360 | CCP / venue template | Template-specific |

### Coupon construction parameters

Treat these as separate trade-template fields, not interchangeable labels:

- **Lookback**: shift the observation window backward by N business days
- **Observation shift**: shift both rates and day weights consistently over the observation window
- **Lockout / rate cutoff**: repeat the last observed fixing for the final N days
- **Payment delay**: pay N business days after the accrual period ends

Desk-standard guidance: model the exact combination from the confirmation, CCP template, or market-standard product definition for that currency.

### OIS compounding formula (ISDA standard)

```
Coupon factor = ∏(1 + r_i × α_i)

Compounded coupon rate over the accrual period:
R = (Coupon factor - 1) / A

where:
  r_i = overnight rate for day i
  α_i = day count fraction for observation i using the overnight index basis
  A = total compounded accrual fraction over the coupon period on the overnight index basis

Implementation note:
  - Lookback, observation shift, and lockout change different parts of the coupon construction
  - Payment delay affects cashflow timing, not which rates are compounded
```

### Audit checklist - OIS

- [ ] Day count matches market convention for currency
- [ ] Daily compounding uses the confirmed overnight coupon convention
- [ ] Lookback, observation shift, lockout, and payment lag are modeled separately
- [ ] Payment lag matches the clearinghouse or bilateral template
- [ ] Stub handling is explicit only for broken-date schedules
- [ ] Business day calendar correct for currency
- [ ] Roll convention respects EOM rule

## Forward Rate Agreements (FRA)

### Market conventions

| Currency | Day count | Fixing lag | Settlement | Rate convention |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| USD | ACT/360 | T-2 | Settlement date | Discounted |
| EUR | ACT/360 | T-2 | Settlement date | Discounted |
| GBP | ACT/365F | T-0 | Settlement date | Discounted |

### FRA pricing formula (ISDA/QuantLib standard)

```
Settlement amount = Notional × (r_fra - r_fix) × τ / (1 + r_fix × τ)

where:
  r_fra = contract FRA rate
  r_fix = fixing rate (reference index)
  τ = accrual period (day count fraction)

Note: Payment is at settlement date, discounted from maturity
```

### QuantLib implementation reference

```cpp
// QuantLib ForwardRateAgreement
FRA(
    valueDate,           // Settlement date
    maturityDate,        // End date of underlying period
    position,            // Long/Short
    strikeRate,          // Contract rate
    notional,
    index,               // e.g., USDLibor3M
    discountingCurve     // For PV calculation
)

// Key: FRA settles discounted at valueDate
```

### Audit checklist - FRA

- [ ] Settlement is discounted (not paid at maturity)
- [ ] Fixing date calculated correctly (spot lag from settlement)
- [ ] Day count matches underlying index
- [ ] FRA rate is simple rate (not compounded)
- [ ] Discount factor uses settlement date

## Basis Swaps

### Market conventions

| Swap type | Leg 1 | Leg 2 | Spread convention |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| OIS-OIS | SOFR | FF | Spread on FF leg |
| Tenor basis | 6M EURIBOR | 3M EURIBOR | Quote convention, tenor-specific |
| XCCY basis | USD SOFR | EUR EURIBOR or €STR leg | Pair-specific market convention |

### QuantLib defaults

```
Basis swap conventions:
- Spread placement: Determined by the quoted market template, not a universal rule
- Notional: Single currency = no exchange; XCCY may be fixed-notional or MTM resettable, with resettable-notional structures common in major currency pairs
- Payment: Same dates or different based on tenor
- Day count: Each leg follows its index convention
```

### Audit checklist - Basis swap

- [ ] Spread applied to correct leg (market convention)
- [ ] Each leg uses its own day count convention
- [ ] XCCY notional exchange and reset mechanics match the product template
- [ ] FX reset rule and notionals are modeled correctly for MTM structures
- [ ] Payment frequencies can differ between legs

## Caps/Floors

### Market conventions

| Currency | Day count | Volatility quote | Premium settlement |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| USD | ACT/360 | Lognormal (Black) | Per confirmation, often spot-style |
| EUR | ACT/360 | Normal (Bachelier) | Per confirmation |
| GBP | ACT/365F | Lognormal or normal by market surface | Per confirmation |

Caps and floors are premium-bearing cash-settled optionlets/floorlets. Do not model them as physically delivered instruments.

### Pricing models

| Model | When to use | Formula reference |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Black-76 | Lognormal vol quotes | Hull Ch. 29 |
| Bachelier | Normal vol quotes (EUR post-2015) | Hull Ch. 29 |
| Shifted Black | Low/negative rate environment | Brigo-Mercurio |
| SABR | Vol smile calibration | Hagan et al. 2002 |

### Black-76 formula (QuantLib/Bloomberg standard)

```
Caplet_price = DF(T_pay) × τ × [F × N(d1) - K × N(d2)]
Floorlet_price = DF(T_pay) × τ × [K × N(-d2) - F × N(-d1)]

d1 = [ln(F/K) + 0.5 × σ² × T] / (σ × √T)
d2 = d1 - σ × √T

where:
  F = forward rate
  K = strike
  σ = lognormal volatility
  T = time to expiry (fixing date)
  τ = accrual period
  DF(T_pay) = discount to payment date
```

### Audit checklist - Caps/Floors

- [ ] Volatility type matches market quote (lognormal vs normal)
- [ ] Time to expiry is to fixing date, not payment date
- [ ] Payment date discounting (not fixing date)
- [ ] Accrual factor uses correct day count
- [ ] For SOFR caps: use compounded forward rate
- [ ] Premium settlement convention (upfront vs running)

## Swaptions

### Market conventions

| Currency | Vol quote | Exercise | Settlement |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| USD | Normal common; lognormal also seen in some markets | European | Physical or cash |
| EUR | Normal (Bachelier) | European | Cash (collateralized cash price) |
| GBP | Normal common; lognormal legacy also seen | European | Physical |

### Cash settlement conventions

```
Market-standard cash settlement depends on currency and market template.

EUR market standard:
- collateralized cash price
- discounting consistent with collateralized swap cashflows

Legacy par-yield / ISDA annuity settlement:
- historical convention for some markets and legacy trades
- do not treat as the default EUR desk standard
```

### QuantLib implementation

```cpp
// European swaption
Swaption(
    swap,                    // Underlying swap
    exercise,                // ExerciseDate
    settlementType,          // Physical or Cash
    settlementMethod         // ParYieldCurve (ISDA) or PhysicalOTC
)

// Pricing engines
BlackSwaptionEngine        // Lognormal vol
BachelierSwaptionEngine    // Normal vol
```

### Audit checklist - Swaptions

- [ ] Vol type matches the quoted market surface and calibration convention
- [ ] Cash settlement method matches the market standard for the currency and trade template
- [ ] Expiry date is exercise date (not settlement)
- [ ] Underlying swap terms match market standard
- [ ] Physical delivery creates actual swap position

## Common implementation errors

### 1. OIS compounding without explicit coupon convention

```rust
// WRONG: Simple average
let rate = daily_rates.iter().sum::<f64>() / daily_rates.len() as f64;

// WRONG: Compounding without observation shift
let compound = daily_rates.iter()
    .fold(1.0, |acc, &r| acc * (1.0 + r * day_frac));

// CORRECT: Compounding with explicit coupon convention parameters
let compound = (0..accrual_days).fold(1.0, |acc, i| {
    let obs_date = apply_ois_observation_convention(
        accrual_start + i,
        lookback_days,
        observation_shift,
        lockout_days,
    );
    let rate = get_fixing(obs_date);
    acc * (1.0 + rate * 1.0/360.0)
});
```

### 2. FRA settling at maturity

```rust
// WRONG: Pay undiscounted at maturity
let payment = notional * (fra_rate - fixing) * tau;

// CORRECT: Pay discounted at settlement
let payment = notional * (fra_rate - fixing) * tau / (1.0 + fixing * tau);
```

### 3. Wrong cap/floor time to expiry

```rust
// WRONG: Time to payment
let time = year_fraction(today, payment_date);

// CORRECT: Time to fixing
let time = year_fraction(today, fixing_date);
```
