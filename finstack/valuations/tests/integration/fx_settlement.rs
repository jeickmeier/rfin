//! FX Settlement Integration Tests
//!
//! Validates FX spot date calculations against ISDA conventions with real holiday
//! calendars. These tests ensure that our joint business day counting logic
//! matches market-standard settlement behavior.
//!
//! # Test Coverage
//!
//! - USD/EUR around New Year (joint holidays on both calendars)
//! - GBP/JPY around UK/JP holidays (asymmetric holiday closures)
//! - USD/GBP around US/UK holidays
//! - Edge cases: Friday trades, multiple consecutive holidays
//!
//! # Convention Notes
//!
//! FX spot settlement follows T+N **joint business days**:
//! - A day is business only if it's business on BOTH currency calendars
//! - Standard spot lag is T+2 for most pairs (T+1 for some like USD/CAD)
//! - Settlement calendars depend on currency pair (not exchange)
//!
//! # Golden File Updates
//!
//! If these tests fail after legitimate convention changes:
//! 1. Review the calendar rules in `finstack/core/data/calendars/`
//! 2. Verify expected dates match published ISDA/bank calendars
//! 3. Update `fx_spot_dates.json` with documented rationale
//!
