//! Tests for day count basis handling in autocallable pricing.
//!
//! These tests validate that autocallables correctly use the discount curve's
//! day count convention for all time calculations:
//! - Observation times use discount curve's DC
//! - Discount factor ratios use discount curve's DC (consistent with observation times)
//! - Vol surface lookup uses discount curve's DC (with assumption surface was calibrated same way)
//!
//! This consistency is critical because mixed time bases distort:
//! - Knock-in/out timing relative to barrier checks
//! - Coupon present values
//! - Final payoff discounting
//!
//! # Market Standards Reference
//!
//! - Equity vol surfaces are typically quoted using ACT/365F
//! - Money market curves (USD) typically use ACT/360
//! - Autocallable pricing is sensitive to time-step alignment with observation dates
//!
//! # Related Issue
//!
//! This test validates the fix for: observation times using discount-curve DC while
//! discount ratios used inst.day_count, causing mixed time bases that distort
//! knock-in/out timing and coupon PVs.
