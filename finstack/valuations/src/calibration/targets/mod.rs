//! Calibration targets for different instrument types.
//!
//! This module provides targets that bridge between the plan-driven calibration API
//! and the domain-specific optimization logic for various financial instruments.
//!
//! # Features
//! - **Standardized Interface**: All targets implement common traits like [`BootstrapTarget`]
//!   or [`GlobalSolveTarget`].
//! - **Broad Asset Coverage**: Support for Interest Rates (IR), Credit, Inflation, and Volatility.
//! - **Automatic Convention Resolution**: Adapters handle the mapping from high-level
//!   market quotes to concrete pricing inputs.
//!
//! # See Also
//! - [`crate::calibration::api`] for the schema that drives these targets.
