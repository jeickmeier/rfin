//!
//! # Rate Conversion: Type-Safe vs Raw Constants
//!
//! For rate/spread conversions, prefer the type-safe types from `finstack_core::types`:
//! - [`finstack_core::types::Rate`] — `Rate::from_percent(5.0)`, `Rate::from_bps(500)`
//! - [`finstack_core::types::Bps`] — `Bps::new(500).as_decimal()`
//! - [`finstack_core::types::Percentage`] — `Percentage::new(5.0).as_decimal()`
//!
//! The raw `f64` constants below (`ONE_BASIS_POINT`, `BASIS_POINTS_PER_UNIT`,
//! `PERCENT_TO_DECIMAL`, `DECIMAL_TO_PERCENT`) exist for use in **performance-sensitive
//! inner loops** where:
//! - Values are already `f64` (e.g., from `Decimal::to_f64()` or curve interpolation)
//! - The `Rate`/`Bps` types are not in scope or would require `i32` truncation
//!   (e.g., fractional basis point spreads)
//! - Avoiding newtype construction overhead matters (tight pricing loops)
//!
//! When writing new code outside hot paths, prefer the core types for clarity and
//! compile-time unit safety.

/// One basis point (0.01%) as a decimal.
///
/// Use this constant instead of hardcoded `0.0001` or `1e-4` for clarity
/// when calculating sensitivity to 1bp changes in rates, spreads, etc.
///
/// **Prefer [`finstack_core::types::Bps`]** for type-safe basis point arithmetic
/// outside hot paths. This raw constant is appropriate for sensitivity bumps
/// (DV01, CS01) and conversions in tight pricing loops where values are already `f64`.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```rust
/// use finstack_valuations::constants::ONE_BASIS_POINT;
///
/// let rate_change = 100.0 * ONE_BASIS_POINT; // 1% or 100bp
/// let notional = 1_000_000.0;
