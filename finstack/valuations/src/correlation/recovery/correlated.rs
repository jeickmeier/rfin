//! Market-correlated stochastic recovery model (Andersen-Sidenius).
//!
//! Models recovery through a latent-factor shock plus a smooth bounding
//! transform. The public parameters are quoted in decimals, so `0.40` means a
//! 40% recovery rate and `0.25` means 25% recovery volatility.
//!
//! # Mathematical Model
//!
//! ```text
//! shock(Z) = ρ_R · σ_R · Z
//! R(Z) = min_R + (max_R - min_R) * logistic(center(μ_R) + shock(Z) / local_slope)
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//! - `μ_R` is the mean recovery at `Z = 0`
//! - `σ_R` is the recovery-volatility scale
//! - `ρ_R` is the factor sensitivity
//! - `Z` is the supplied latent market factor
//!
//! The implementation does **not** hard-clamp an affine recovery rule. Instead,
//! it uses a logistic transform so recovery stays inside the configured bounds
//! smoothly while preserving the target mean exactly at `Z = 0`.
//!
//! # Sign Convention
//!
//! The sign of `Z` is caller-defined. With the crate's preset calibrations
//! (`ρ_R < 0`), negative factor realizations increase recovery and positive
//! realizations decrease it. Callers that want the opposite mapping should
//! either negate the factor they pass in or choose a positive `ρ_R`.
//!
//! # Calibration
//!
//! Typical market calibration from CDX equity tranche:
//! - Mean recovery: 40%
//! - Recovery volatility: 20-30%
//! - Factor correlation: -30% to -50%
//!
