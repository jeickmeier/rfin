//! Market convention definitions for indices, options, and credit.
//!
//! This module defines the data structures for all market convention types. Conventions capture
//! market-standard parameters such as day count conventions, business day adjustments, payment
//! frequencies, and settlement lags that are required for accurate instrument construction
//! and pricing.
