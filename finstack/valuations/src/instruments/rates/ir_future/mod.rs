//! Interest rate futures with convexity adjustments for curve calibration.
//!
//! Interest rate futures are exchange-traded contracts on future interest rates.
//! Major contracts include SOFR futures, Eurodollar futures, and Short Sterling
//! futures. They require convexity adjustments when used for curve calibration.
//!
//! # Contract Types
//!
//! - **SOFR futures**: 3-month SOFR rate (CME)
//! - **Eurodollar futures**: 3-month USD LIBOR (historical, now SOFR)
//! - **Short Sterling**: 3-month GBP LIBOR (historical, now SONIA)
//! - **Euribor futures**: 3-month EUR EURIBOR
//!
//! # Price Convention
//!
//! Futures quote = 100 - Implied Rate (in %)
//!
//! Example: Price 99.50 implies 0.50% rate
//!
//! # Convexity Adjustment
//!
//! Futures rates differ from forward rates due to daily marking:
//!
//! ```text
//! Forward_rate = Futures_rate - Convexity_adjustment
//! ```
//!
//! where convexity adjustment depends on rate volatility and time to expiry.
//!
//! Typical adjustment: 1-5 basis points for nearby contracts, larger for deferred.
//!
//! # Pricing
//!
//! Present value of futures position:
//!
//! ```text
//! PV = Contracts × Contract_size × (Price_market - Price_entry) × Tick_value
//! ```
//!
//! For calibration, futures imply forward rates that price instruments.
//!
//! # Market Conventions
//!
//! - **Contract size**: $1,000,000 (SOFR), $1,000,000 (Eurodollar)
//! - **Tick value**: $25 per basis point typically
//! - **Expiry**: IMM dates (3rd Wednesday of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec)
//! - **Settlement**: Cash-settled to reference rate
