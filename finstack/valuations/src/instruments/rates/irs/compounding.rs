//! Compounding conventions for floating leg calculations in interest rate swaps.
//!
//! Defines how floating rate coupons are calculated based on the
//! underlying reference rate (LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA, etc.).
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! ## Compounded-in-Arrears (Full Daily Compounding)
//!
//! For overnight-indexed swaps (OIS) with `CompoundedInArrears` compounding,
//! the implementation uses **full daily compounding** per ISDA 2021:
//!
//! ```text
//! Coupon = N × [∏(1 + r_i × dcf_i) - 1] + spread × accrual
//! ```
//!
//! where the product is taken over daily observations in the accrual period.
//!
//! ## Fast Path for Unseasoned Single-Curve OIS
//!
//! When all of the following conditions are met, the discount curve identity
//! is used as an optimization:
//!
//! - Swap is unseasoned (`as_of <= accrual_start`)
//! - No lookback or observation shift (`lookback_days = 0`, `observation_shift = None`)
//! - Forward curve ID matches discount curve ID (single-curve)
//!
//! In this case:
//! ```text
//! ∏(1 + r_i × dcf_i) = DF(start) / DF(end)
//! ```
//!
//! This identity is exact and avoids iterating over daily observations.
//!
//! ## Lookback and Observation Shift
//!
//! The `lookback_days` and `observation_shift` parameters are fully supported:
//!
//! - **Lookback**: Shifts observation dates back from the accrual period. For example,
//!   with `lookback_days = 2`, observations for the period Jan 1-Apr 1 would be
//!   taken from Dec 28-Mar 28 (2 business days earlier).
//!
//! - **Observation Shift**: Additional adjustment to observation dates. The total
//!   shift is computed as `-lookback_days + observation_shift`.
//!
//! When lookback/shift is non-zero, the fast path is disabled and full daily
//! compounding is performed with shifted observation dates.
//!
//! ## Seasoned Swaps
//!
//! For seasoned swaps where `as_of` falls within an accrual period, historical
//! fixings are required for observation dates before `as_of`. Provide fixings
//! via `ScalarTimeSeries` with id `FIXING:{forward_curve_id}`.
