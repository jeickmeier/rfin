//! Fixed leg annuity calculation for interest rate swaps.
//!
//! Computes the sum of discounted accrual factors on the fixed leg, which
//! represents the present value of receiving $1 per unit coupon on each
//! fixed payment date.
//!
//! # Definition
//!
//! ```text
//! Annuity = Σ α_i × DF(T_i + payment_delay)
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//! - `α_i` = accrual factor for period i (from day count convention)
//! - `DF(T_i + payment_delay)` = discount factor to actual payment date (relative to valuation date)
//! - Sum includes only future cashflows (T_i > as_of)
//! - `payment_delay` = payment delay in business days (typically 2 for OIS swaps)
//!
//! # Applications
//!
//! The annuity is a fundamental quantity used in:
//! - **Par rate calculation**: `Par Rate = PV_float / (Notional × Annuity)`
//! - **DV01 approximation**: Change in swap value for 1bp rate change
//! - **Duration metrics**: Effective duration and modified duration
//! - **Risk scaling**: Converting PV sensitivities to rate sensitivities
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! For IRS fixed legs we always treat coupons as simple interest; the
//! compounding configuration affects coupon accrual (handled in cashflow
//! builders), not the annuity weight calculation itself.
//!
//! Payment delay is applied using weekday-only business day adjustment
//! (skipping weekends). For precise holiday-aware adjustments, use a full
//! calendar-based schedule builder.
//!
//! # Numerical Stability
//!
//! Uses Kahan compensated summation to minimize floating-point rounding errors,
//! which is critical for long-dated swaps (30Y+) with many periods. This ensures
//! deterministic, accurate results across platforms.
