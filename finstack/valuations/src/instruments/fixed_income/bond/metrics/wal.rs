//! Weighted Average Life (WAL) calculator for bonds.

/// Calculates Weighted Average Life (WAL) for bonds.
///
/// WAL measures the average time until principal is repaid, weighted by the
/// amount of principal returned at each date. For bullet bonds WAL equals
/// the time to maturity; for amortizing bonds it is shorter.
///
/// # Formula
///
/// ```text
/// WAL = Σ(Principal_i × Time_i) / Σ(Principal_i)
/// ```
///
/// where `Principal_i` is the principal repayment at date `i` and `Time_i` is
/// the year fraction from the valuation date to that payment using ACT/365F.
///
/// # Principal Flow Selection
///
/// The calculator uses the full cashflow schedule (via `get_full_schedule`) and
/// selects only `CFKind::Amortization` and positive `CFKind::Notional` flows.
/// This correctly excludes coupons, PIK accruals, and the initial negative
/// notional draw, giving an accurate principal-only WAL.
