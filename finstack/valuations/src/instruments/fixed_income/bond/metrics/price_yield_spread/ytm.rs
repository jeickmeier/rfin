/// Calculates yield to maturity (YTM) for bonds.
///
/// YTM is defined here as the internal rate of return that equates the present
/// value of **all projected future cashflows** to the current dirty market
/// price (quoted clean price plus accrued interest at the **quote date**).
///
/// # Quote-Date Convention
///
/// YTM is computed relative to the **quote date** (settlement date when
/// `settlement_days` is set, otherwise `as_of`):
/// - Accrued interest is computed at the quote date
/// - Cashflows before the quote date are excluded
/// - Time to each cashflow is measured from the quote date
///
/// This matches market convention where bond quotes are settlement-date quotes.
///
/// # Applicability
///
/// - **Primary use**: plain-vanilla **fixed-rate bullet bonds**, where YTM has
///   the usual market interpretation (coupon-like yield for comparison).
/// - **Other cashflow specs**: for floating-rate, amortizing, or custom
///   cashflow structures, this calculator still solves a well-defined IRR off
///   the full discounted cashflow schedule. The resulting YTM is a
///   **cashflow-implied yield**, but it is **not** the market-standard quote
///   for FRNs (where **discount margin** is preferred) and may have less direct
///   interpretation for exotic structures.
///
/// Implementation detail: the `coupon_rate` field in `YtmPricingSpec` is used
/// only as a **solver hint / initial guess**. For non-fixed `CashflowSpec`
/// variants this is set to `0.0`, but the solved YTM is fully determined by
/// the explicit projected cashflows and the target price, not by this hint.
///
/// # Dependencies
///
/// None (accrued is computed internally at quote_date).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use finstack_valuations::instruments::fixed_income::bond::Bond;
/// use finstack_valuations::metrics::{MetricRegistry, MetricId, MetricContext};
/// use finstack_core::market_data::context::MarketContext;
/// use finstack_core::dates::Date;
///
/// # let bond = Bond::example();
/// # let market = MarketContext::new();
/// # let as_of = Date::from_calendar_date(2024, time::Month::January, 15).unwrap();
/// // YTM is computed automatically when requesting bond metrics
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
