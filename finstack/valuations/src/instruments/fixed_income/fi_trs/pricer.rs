//! Fixed Income Index TRS pricing - carry/yield analytics model.
//!
//! This module implements **carry-oriented analytics** for the total return leg of fixed income index TRS
//! using a carry-based model where the index yield drives the expected total return.
//!
//! # Model Choice
//!
//! For fixed income index TRS, two approaches exist:
//!
//! 1. **No-arbitrage forward model**: `F_t = S_0 * e^{(r-y)*t}`, total return equals
//!    the risk-free rate. Mathematically correct but has no yield sensitivity since
//!    the price return and income terms cancel exactly under the multiplicative formula.
//!
//! 2. **Carry model** (used here): Total return per period = `e^{y * dt} - 1`.
//!    This models the index as earning its yield continuously, which is the primary
//!    economic driver of FI index TRS. Rate sensitivity comes from discounting future
//!    payments and is captured separately by the DV01/DurationDv01 metrics.
//!
//! We use the carry model because:
//! - FI index TRS are fundamentally carry products (yield vs financing cost)
//! - Yield sensitivity is essential for what-if analysis and hedge ratio computation
//! - It matches how dealers think about TRS economics: par spread ≈ yield - financing rate
//!
//! This is **not** a full production mark-to-market model for fixed income index TRS.
//! It intentionally omits roll-down and mark-to-market from underlying rate/spread moves.
