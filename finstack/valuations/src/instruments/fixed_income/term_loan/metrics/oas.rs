/// Calculates Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for callable term loans.
///
/// Uses tree-based callable pricing and solves for the constant spread (returned in **decimal**
/// units, e.g. `0.01 = 100bp`) that makes the model price equal to the market price.
///
/// # OAS Convention
///
/// OAS is a **parallel shift to the calibrated risk-free short rate lattice** (in basis points).
/// When the rates+credit two-factor tree is used (i.e. a hazard curve is present in
/// the market context), the hazard tree captures the credit spread independently, so
/// the OAS represents the spread **over the risk-free curve** — consistent with the
/// Bloomberg OAS convention for risky instruments.
///
/// # Dependencies
///
/// Requires `quoted_clean_price` to be set in `loan.pricing_overrides` (as percent of par).
