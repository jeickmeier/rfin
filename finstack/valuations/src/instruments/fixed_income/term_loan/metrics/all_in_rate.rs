//! All-in rate metric for term loans.
//!
//! Computes the effective annualized borrower **cash cost** including cash interest
//! and periodic fees, divided by time-weighted outstanding principal.
//!
//! This metric reads cash flows directly from the full cashflow schedule,
//! ensuring perfect consistency with the cashflow generator. PIK interest is
//! excluded from the numerator (cash cost only) but affects outstanding.
