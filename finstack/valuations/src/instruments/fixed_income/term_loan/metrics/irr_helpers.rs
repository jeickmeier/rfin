//! Shared IRR calculation helpers for term loan yield metrics.
//!
//! This module provides unified IRR solving for YTM, YTC, YTW, and YT2Y/3Y/4Y metrics.
//!
//! All helpers use **kind-aware cashflow filtering** from the full schedule to ensure
//! correct treatment at exercise boundaries:
//! - Coupons/fees (all variants: `Fee`, `CommitmentFee`, `UsageFee`, `FacilityFee`):
//!   included up to AND including the exercise date
//! - Amortization/Notional: included only BEFORE the exercise date (implicitly
//!   captured in the pre-exercise outstanding used for the redemption leg)
//! - PIK and negative Notional (funding): always excluded

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `loan` - The term loan instrument

/// * `as_of` - Valuation date
/// * `target_price` - Purchase price (dirty price, typically base PV)
/// * `exercise_date` - Exercise/call/maturity date
/// * `redemption` - Redemption amount at exercise date
///
/// # Returns
///
/// IRR (as decimal) that equates the initial price to the present value of
/// holder-view flows plus redemption.
