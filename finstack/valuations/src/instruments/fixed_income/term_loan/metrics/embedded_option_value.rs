//! Embedded call option value for callable term loans.
//!
//! Computed by pricing the loan twice on the same tree model:
//! 1) With call schedule (borrower optimal exercise with friction) -> P_callable
//! 2) Without call schedule (no optionality) -> P_straight
//!
//! The embedded call option value is returned as:
//!   V_call = P_straight - P_callable
//!
//! This is positive when callability reduces lender value (borrower owns the call).
