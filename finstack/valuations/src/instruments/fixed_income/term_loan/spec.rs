//! Serde-stable specification types for term loans and DDTL features.
//!
//! This module defines the serializable specification structures for term loans
//! including delayed-draw term loans (DDTL), covenant events, amortization schedules,
//! and call provisions.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! All types in this module are designed for stable serialization with:
//! - `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to catch configuration errors
//! - Explicit field naming for long-lived pipelines
//! - Conversion to/from runtime [`TermLoan`](super::types::TermLoan) instances
//!
//! # Key Types
//!
//! - [`TermLoanSpec`]: Complete loan specification (serializable)
//! - [`DdtlSpec`]: Delayed-draw term loan features
//! - [`CovenantSpec`]: Covenant-driven events
//! - [`AmortizationSpec`]: Principal repayment schedules
//! - [`LoanCallSchedule`]: Borrower prepayment options
//! - [`OidPolicy`]: Original issue discount handling
//! - [`OidEirSpec`]: Effective interest rate amortization settings
//!

/// Original Issue Discount (OID) policy for term loan origination.
///
/// OID represents the discount from par value at loan origination. The policy
/// determines how the discount is handled: withheld from proceeds or tracked separately.
///
/// # Industry Practice
///
/// OID is common in institutional term loans and private credit, particularly for:
/// - Leveraged buyout financing (LBO loans)
/// - Distressed refinancings
/// - High-yield institutional term loans
///
/// Typical OID ranges from 1-5% (100-500 bps) of par value.
///
/// # Accounting Treatment
///
/// OID affects accounting under GAAP/IFRS:
/// - **Withheld**: Reduces initial cash proceeds, increases effective yield
/// - **Separate**: May be accounted as upfront fee or amortized discount
///
/// For effective interest rate (EIR) amortization schedules, see [`OidEirSpec`].
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `WithheldPct`: Discount as percentage withheld from funded amount
/// - `WithheldAmount`: Fixed amount withheld from funded proceeds
/// - `SeparatePct`: Percentage tracked separately, not withheld
/// - `SeparateAmount`: Fixed amount tracked separately
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```text
/// use finstack_valuations::instruments::fixed_income::term_loan::spec::OidPolicy;
/// use finstack_core::money::Money;
/// use finstack_core::currency::Currency;
///
/// // 2% OID withheld from proceeds
/// let oid = OidPolicy::WithheldPct(200);  // 200 bps = 2%
///
/// // $50,000 fixed OID
/// let oid_fixed = OidPolicy::WithheldAmount(Money::new(50_000.0, Currency::USD));

/// DDTLs are common in:
/// - **Construction financing**: Funds released as construction milestones are met

///
/// Typical features:
/// - Commitment period: 6-24 months
/// - Commitment fees: 25-50 bps on undrawn amounts
/// - Usage fees: 0-25 bps on drawn amounts
