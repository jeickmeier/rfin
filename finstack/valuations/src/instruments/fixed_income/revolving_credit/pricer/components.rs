//! Shared components for revolving credit pricing.

//! Currently exposes only `compute_upfront_fee_pv`. Earlier iterations of this
//! file carried a speculative `RateProjector` trait family (with `FixedRateProjector`,
//! `FloatingRateProjector`, `TermLockedRateProjector`) plus `DiscountFactors`,
//! `SurvivalWeights`, and `FeeCalculator` infrastructure. None of it was wired
//! into the live pricing path — the `unified.rs` engine and the MC path generator
//! resolve forward curves and survival probabilities directly. The dead scaffolding
//! has been removed; revive from git history if a future stochastic-fee path
//! genuinely needs it.
