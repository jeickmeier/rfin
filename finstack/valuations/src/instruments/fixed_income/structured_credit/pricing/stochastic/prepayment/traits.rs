//! Stochastic prepayment trait definition.
//!
//! The [`StochasticPrepayment`] trait provides a common interface for all
//! prepayment models that incorporate systematic risk factors.

/// Stochastic prepayment model interface.
///
/// Implementations provide conditional prepayment rates given:
/// - Loan seasoning (months since origination)
/// - Systematic factor realizations
/// - Market conditions (interest rates)
/// - Pool burnout state
///
/// # Mathematical Framework
///
/// General form:
/// ```text
/// SMM(t, Z) = f(base_smm, Z, market_rate, burnout)
/// ```
///
/// where:
/// - Z is the systematic factor realization
/// - market_rate is the current mortgage rate
/// - burnout captures historical prepayment exhaustion
pub trait StochasticPrepayment: Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug {
    /// Conditional SMM given factor realizations.
    ///
    /// Returns the single monthly mortality rate conditional on:
    /// - `seasoning`: Months since origination
    /// - `factors`: Systematic factor values [prepay_factor, ...]
    /// - `market_rate`: Current mortgage rate (for refi incentive)
    /// - `burnout`: Burnout factor in [0, 1] (1 = no burnout)
