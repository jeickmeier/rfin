//! Stochastic prepayment models for structured credit.
//!
//! This module provides factor-driven prepayment models that capture:
//! - Interest rate sensitivity (refinancing incentive)
//! - Burnout effects (pool exhaustion)
//! - Seasonality patterns
//! - Correlation with systematic factors
//!
//! # Models
//!
//! - **FactorCorrelatedPrepay**: Base CPR shocked by systematic factor
//! - **RichardRollPrepay**: Full RMBS prepayment model with refi incentive
//! - **RegimeSwitchingPrepay**: Two-state prepayment model
//!
