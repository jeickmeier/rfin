//! Shared pricing utilities for swap legs.
//!
//! This module consolidates the floating and fixed leg pricing logic that was
//! previously duplicated across IRS, BasisSwap, and other swap instruments.
//! The implementation preserves the Bloomberg-validated methodology from IRS.
//!
//! # Key Features
//!
//! - Numerical stability via robust relative discount factor calculation
//! - Neumaier compensated summation for long-dated swaps
//! - Holiday-aware payment delay handling
//! - Compounded-in-arrears support for RFR swaps (SOFR, SONIA, etc.)
//! - Forward rate projection with floor/cap/gearing
//!
//! # Bloomberg Validation
//!
//! The `robust_relative_df` function implements the same numerical stability
//! checks used in IRS pricing that have been validated against Bloomberg SWPM
//! for discount factor calibration.

/// Minimum threshold for annuity values to avoid divide-by-zero in par spread calculations.
///
/// # Numerical Justification
///
/// For a typical swap with $1MM notional:
/// - 10Y swap with semi-annual payments and DF ~0.80: annuity ≈ 8.0
/// - 30Y swap with quarterly payments and DF ~0.30: annuity ≈ 15.0
/// - 1Y swap with annual payment and DF ~0.95: annuity ≈ 0.95
///
/// The threshold of 1e-12 is triggered when:
/// - All periods have expired (no future cashflows)
/// - Extreme discounting scenarios (e.g., +200% rates over 30Y gives DF ~1e-26)
/// - Instrument misconfiguration (zero-length accrual periods)
///
/// This threshold is very conservative to ensure we catch only pathological cases,
/// not legitimate stress scenarios. For comparison, a 1bp annuity change on a $1MM
/// notional would be ~$100, so 1e-12 corresponds to sub-nanodollar precision.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Used in par rate and par spread calculations where dividing by annuity is required.
/// Failing on near-zero annuity is preferable to returning NaN/Inf which would
/// propagate through downstream calculations.

/// - Positive (non-negative DFs are non-physical under standard assumptions)
///
/// It does **not** validate the absolute DF at `as_of` against a hard threshold (like 1e-10),
