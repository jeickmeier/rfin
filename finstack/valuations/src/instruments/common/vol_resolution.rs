//! Shared helpers for resolving volatility from overrides or a vol surface.
//!
//! The canonical pattern across surface-driven pricers is to first check whether
//! `MarketQuoteOverrides::implied_volatility` is set and, if so, use it as a flat
//! σ across tenor and strike. Otherwise, look up the surface at `(t, strike)`
//! with clamping at the grid edges.
//!
//! This module centralises that pattern so new pricers can opt in with a single
//! call and existing pricers can be migrated away from ad-hoc `if let Some(iv)`
//! blocks.

use crate::instruments::pricing_overrides::MarketQuoteOverrides;
use finstack_core::market_data::context::MarketContext;

/// Resolve the volatility σ to use at `(t, strike)` for a surface-driven pricer.
///
/// Precedence:
///
/// 1. `overrides.implied_volatility` — when set, interpreted as a flat σ across
///    tenor and strike (standard revaluation convention).
/// 2. Surface lookup via `curves.get_surface(surface_id).value_clamped(t, strike)`.
///
/// Use this in every pricer that previously wrote the inline
/// `if let Some(iv) = overrides.implied_volatility { iv } else { surface.value_clamped(t, K) }`
/// pattern.
