//! Recovery01 calculator for CDS.
//!
//! Computes Recovery01 (recovery rate sensitivity) using finite differences.
//! Recovery01 measures the change in PV for a 1% (100bp) change in recovery rate.
//!
//! ## Methodology
//!
//! Uses central differences when possible, with automatic fallback to one-sided
//! differences at recovery rate boundaries:
//!
//! - **Central difference** (interior): `(PV(R+h) - PV(R-h)) / (2h)`
//! - **Forward difference** (near R=0): `(PV(R+h) - PV(R)) / h`
//! - **Backward difference** (near R=1): `(PV(R) - PV(R-h)) / h`
//!
//! This ensures consistent, unbiased sensitivity estimates even when the base
//! recovery rate is near the valid bounds [0, 1].
//!
//! ## Hazard Curve Recalibration
//!
//! When the hazard curve carries the par-spread quotes it was bootstrapped
//! from (`par_spread_points` non-empty), the bumped recovery is propagated
//! through a full re-bootstrap of the survival curve so the observed CDS
//! spreads remain consistent. This captures the indirect `h ≈ S/(1-R)` effect
//! that dominates the recovery sensitivity for distressed credits.
//!
//! When the curve has no stored par spreads (e.g. a hand-built knot curve
//! used in tests or a curve loaded without preserving its calibration
//! quotes), the calculator falls back to a "frozen-curve" bump: the recovery
//! is bumped on the instrument only and the survival curve is reused
//! unchanged. This produces a *partial* recovery sensitivity that, for
//! spread-bootstrapped curves, typically understates the true value by 2-5x.
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! Recovery rate changes affect both the protection leg (LGD = 1 - recovery)
//! and the premium leg (accrued on default settlement). This metric captures
//! the full direct sensitivity across both legs.
