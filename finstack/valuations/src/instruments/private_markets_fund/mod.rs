//! Private markets fund modeling with waterfall distributions.
//!
//! Models private equity and private credit funds with:
//! - Multi-period NAV evolution
//! - Tiered waterfall distributions (GP/LP splits)
//! - Hurdle rates and catch-up provisions
//! - Carried interest calculations
//! - Management and performance fees
//!
//! # Fund Structure
//!
//! Typical private fund waterfall:
//! 1. **Return of capital**: LPs receive initial investments back
//! 2. **Preferred return**: LPs receive hurdle rate (e.g., 8% IRR)
//! 3. **Catch-up**: GP receives distributions until target carry achieved
//! 4. **Carried interest**: Profits split (typically 80/20 LP/GP)
//!
//! # Pricing
//!
//! Private funds are valued by discounting projected NAV distributions:
//!
//! ```text
//! PV = Σ Distribution(t) · DF(t)
//! ```
//!
//! where distributions follow the contractual waterfall based on NAV evolution.
//!
//! # Key Metrics
//!
//! - **NAV**: Net Asset Value (fund portfolio value)
//! - **DPI**: Distributions to Paid-In capital ratio
//! - **TVPI**: Total Value to Paid-In (DPI + RVPI)
//! - **IRR**: Internal Rate of Return
//! - **NAV01**: Sensitivity to NAV changes
//! - **Carry01**: Sensitivity to carried interest rate
//!
