# FX Barrier Option

## Features

- Up/down, in/out FX barrier options with optional rebate and Gobet–Miri adjustment toggle.
- Separate domestic/foreign discount curves, FX spot ID, and FX vol surface; supports call/put on the FX rate.
- Explicit dispatch by monitoring mode:
  - `use_gobet_miri = false`: analytical Reiner–Rubinstein (continuous monitoring)
  - `use_gobet_miri = true`: Monte Carlo discrete-monitoring-corrected pricing (`mc` feature required)

## Methodology & References

- Reiner & Rubinstein (1991) closed-form formulas adapted to FX (Garman–Kohlhagen carry).
- Optional Gobet–Miri (2001) barrier shift for discrete monitoring.
- Monte Carlo fallback uses the shared path-dependent engine under GBM assumptions.

## Usage Example

```rust
use finstack_valuations::instruments::fx::fx_barrier_option::FxBarrierOption;

let option = FxBarrierOption::example();
let pv = option.value(&market_context, as_of_date)?;
```

## Limitations / Known Issues

- Assumes log-normal FX dynamics with deterministic domestic/foreign rates.
- Discrete-monitoring mode requires `mc`; otherwise pricing returns a validation error instead of silently switching models.
- Monte Carlo path requires the `mc` feature; no stochastic volatility or jumps.
- European-style payoff only; no early exercise or windowed monitoring beyond the supplied schedule.

## Pricing Methodology

- Reiner–Rubinstein continuous barrier formulas adapted to Garman–Kohlhagen FX carry; optional Gobet–Miri shift for discrete monitoring.
- Monte Carlo GBM fallback for complex cases; domestic/foreign discount curves supply carry, vol from FX surface.
- Spot FX from market data or override; rebate handled at expiry.
- Expired contracts require `observed_barrier_breached`; terminal FX spot alone cannot recover the realized barrier history.
- Knock-in rebates pay on no-hit and knock-out rebates pay on hit, including expired-state settlement.
- Zero-vol and very-low-vol analytical paths are resolved deterministically when the continuous formula becomes ill-conditioned.

## Metrics

- PV plus Greeks (delta/gamma/vega/theta/rho) analytically; MC bump-and-revalue when enabled.
- Barrier hit probability proxies via MC path statistics; carry sensitivity via domestic/foreign curve bumps.
- Scenario PVs for barrier shifts and vol surface tweaks.

## Future Enhancements

- Add discrete-monitoring corrections and barrier smoothing techniques for FX calendar specifics.
- Support stochastic/local vol and jumps; quanto adjustments for cross-currency settlements.
- Include early-exercise/windowed barrier styles if demanded by products.
