# FX Swap

## Features
- Near/far FX swap with explicit base/quote currencies, settlement dates, and base notional.
- Optional explicit near/far rates or forward points; otherwise derives spot/forward from FX matrix and discount curves.
- Uses domestic and foreign discount curves and integrates with FX matrix for conversions.

## Methodology & References
- Standard FX swap PV: discount near/far exchanges in each currency, convert foreign leg to domestic via spot/forward, and sum.
- Forward parity uses `F = S × DF_for / DF_dom` when far rate not supplied.
- Deterministic discounting; no funding adjustments or cross-currency basis beyond curve inputs.

## Usage Example
```rust
use finstack_valuations::instruments::fx_swap::FxSwap;

let swap = FxSwap::example();
let pv = swap.value(&market_context, as_of_date)?;
```

## Limitations / Known Issues
- Assumes availability of FX matrix when near/far rates are absent.
- No explicit CSA/basis handling beyond the chosen curves; funding adjustments must be modeled externally.
- Does not model optional early termination or broken-date rollovers beyond supplied dates.

## Pricing Methodology
- Discounts near/far exchanges in each currency using domestic/foreign curves; converts foreign leg via spot/forward.
- Forward derived from parity if `far_rate` absent: `F = S × DF_for / DF_dom`; near rate from FX matrix or override.
- PV is sum of domestic leg and converted foreign leg; deterministic two-leg valuation.

## Metrics
- PV plus forward points and par far rate implied from curves.
- DV01 on domestic/foreign curves and FX delta exposures via bump-and-revalue.
- Cashflow breakdown by near/far legs for attribution.

## Future Enhancements
- Add CSA/basis spread handling and discount-curve alignment diagnostics.
- Support broken-date interpolation for near/far beyond standard tenors.
- Provide FX swaption hooks or optional early termination features.
