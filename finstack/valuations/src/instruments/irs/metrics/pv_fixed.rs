//! Fixed leg present value calculation for interest rate swaps.
//!
//! Computes the present value of all future fixed coupon payments by
//! discounting them using the discount curve specified in the fixed leg.
//!
//! # Calculation
//!
//! ```text
//! PV_fixed = Σ Notional × Fixed_Rate × α_i × DF(T_i)
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//! - `α_i` = accrual factor for period i (from day count convention)
//! - `DF(T_i)` = discount factor to payment date i
//! - Sum includes only future cashflows (T_i > as_of)
//!
//! # Use Cases
//!
//! - Computing individual leg PVs for risk analysis
//! - Decomposing swap value into fixed vs floating components
//! - Calibration and curve fitting workflows
