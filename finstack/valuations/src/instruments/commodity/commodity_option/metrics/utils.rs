/// Determines the forward price driver for bumping in Greek calculations.
///
/// The forward price can come from multiple sources, and the bump strategy
/// must match the pricing retrieval order to ensure consistent sensitivities.
///
/// # Priority Order
///
/// 1. **`quoted_forward`**: If the instrument has a direct forward price override
/// 2. **`PriceCurve`**: If a PriceCurve exists for `forward_curve_id` in market data
/// 3. **`spot_price_id`**: Fallback to spot scalar (propagates via cost-of-carry)
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This enum is used by gamma and vanna calculators to determine what to bump
/// when computing forward-based sensitivities for Black-76 priced options.
