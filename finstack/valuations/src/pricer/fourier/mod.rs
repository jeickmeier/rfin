//! Fourier pricing methods for European options.
//!
//! This module provides model-agnostic Fourier pricing engines that work
//! with any model implementing the [`CharacteristicFunction`] trait from
//! `finstack-core`. One method is currently available:
//!
//! - **COS method** ([`cos::CosPricer`]): Fang-Oosterlee (2008) cosine series
//!   expansion. O(N) per strike, fastest single-strike Fourier method.
//!   Automatic truncation range from cumulants. No external dependencies.
//!
//! # Method Selection Guide
//!
//! | Use Case | Recommended Method |
//! |----------|-------------------|
//! | Single-strike pricing | COS (fastest) |
//! | Strip pricing (5-50 strikes) | COS with strip reuse |
//! | Arbitrary strike, no grid | COS (recommended) |
//! | WASM / latency-critical | COS (smallest N) |
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use finstack_core::math::characteristic_function::BlackScholesCf;
//! use finstack_valuations::pricer::fourier::cos::{CosPricer, CosConfig};
//!
//! let cf = BlackScholesCf { r: 0.05, q: 0.0, sigma: 0.2 };
//!
//! // COS method (r encodes the drift already present in the CF)
//! let cos = CosPricer::new(&cf, CosConfig::default());
//! let call = cos.price_call(100.0, 100.0, 0.05, 1.0);
//! ```
//!
//! # Removed: Lewis (2001) pricer
//!
//! A `LewisPricer` was previously exposed here. Quant-audit findings C4
//! and C7 identified it as known-divergent off-ATM (with a regression
//! test that *asserted* the buggy behavior) and as silently dropping
//! non-finite integrand panels behind a `max(0.0)` clamp. Because no
//! internal pricer consumed it, and callers had no way to distinguish
//! its correct ATM behavior from its off-ATM collapse, the module was
//! removed in quant-audit remediation PR 2. Use [`cos::CosPricer`] for
//! all Fourier pricing; it handles arbitrary strikes with Fang-Oosterlee
//! truncation from cumulants. See the full audit at
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-quant-audit-remediation-roadmap.md`.
//!
//! [`CharacteristicFunction`]: finstack_core::math::characteristic_function::CharacteristicFunction
