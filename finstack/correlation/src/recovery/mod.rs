//! Stochastic recovery models for credit portfolio pricing.
//!
//! This module provides recovery-rate models used alongside latent-factor
//! default models. Recovery is expressed in decimals, so `0.40` means a 40%
//! recovery rate and `0.60` LGD.
//!
//! # Constant vs Stochastic Recovery
//!
//! - **Constant**: Simplest model, uses fixed recovery (e.g., 40%)
//! - **Stochastic**: Recovery varies with market conditions
//!
//! # Stochastic Recovery Models
//!
//! ## Market-Correlated (Andersen-Sidenius)
//!
//! Recovery is driven by a bounded transformation of a latent factor shock:
//! ```text
//! shock(Z) = ρ_R · σ_R · Z
//! R(Z) = bounded_transform(μ_R, shock(Z), min_R, max_R)
//! ```
//! where:
//! - `μ_R` is the target mean recovery at `Z = 0`
//! - `σ_R` is the recovery-volatility scale
//! - `ρ_R` controls the sign and magnitude of factor sensitivity
//! - the bounded transform maps the shocked recovery smoothly into
//!   `[min_R, max_R]`
//!
//! The sign convention for `Z` is caller-defined. In the current implementation,
//! the preset calibrations use a negative `ρ_R`, so negative factor realizations
//! increase recovery and positive realizations decrease it.
