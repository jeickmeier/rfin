# finstack-monte-carlo

`finstack-monte-carlo` is the Monte Carlo simulation crate in the `finstack`
workspace. It provides reusable pricing infrastructure for quantitative finance:
random streams, stochastic processes, discretization schemes, payoffs, pricing
engines, captured-path diagnostics, variance reduction, and Monte Carlo result
types with explicit currencies.

The crate is designed around a small set of composable traits:

- `RandomStream` for deterministic random-number generation
- `StochasticProcess` for model dynamics
- `Discretization` for time stepping
- `Payoff` for pathwise payoff logic
- `McEngine` for orchestration and statistics

Most users start in one of three places:

- `finstack_monte_carlo::prelude::*` for ergonomic imports
- `engine::McEngine` for the fully generic simulation loop
- `pricer::european::EuropeanPricer` for a compact GBM-only entry point

## What This Crate Covers

Available functionality:

- Generic Monte Carlo pricing engine with serial and parallel execution
- Deterministic splittable pseudo-random generation via `rng::philox::PhiloxRng`
- Sobol / quasi-random generators and Brownian-bridge utilities
- GBM, Brownian, multi-GBM, OU, Heston, CIR, Hull-White, Vasicek,
  jump-diffusion, Bates, Schwartz-Smith, rough-volatility, and LMM-style
  process support
- Exact, Euler, Milstein, QE, jump-Euler, and model-specific discretizations
- Vanilla and path-dependent payoffs such as European, Asian, basket, barrier,
  and lookback options
- European, path-dependent, and Longstaff-Schwartz LSMC pricers
- Monte Carlo Greeks via pathwise, likelihood-ratio, and finite-difference
  estimators
- Online summary statistics and currency-aware pricing results
- Optional captured-path datasets for diagnostics and visualization
- Variance-reduction tools such as antithetic pairing, control variates, moment
  matching, and importance sampling

## Feature Flags

This crate currently declares no optional Cargo features. Rayon-backed parallel
simulation and the broader model/pricer/payoff surface are compiled by default.

## Core Workflow

At a high level, pricing works like this:

1. Build an `McEngine` with a time grid and runtime options.
2. Choose an RNG, usually `PhiloxRng` for deterministic replay and parallel safety.
3. Select a `StochasticProcess` and a compatible `Discretization`.
4. Provide the initial process state as a raw `&[f64]`.
5. Choose or implement a `Payoff`.
6. Call `price()` for aggregate results or `price_with_capture()` for aggregate
   results plus captured paths.

The engine owns the simulation loop, Welford-style online statistics, optional
parallel chunking, optional early stopping, and optional path capture.

## Quick Start

### Generic Engine Example

This is the canonical way to use the crate when you want explicit control over
the engine, RNG, process, discretization, and payoff.

```rust,no_run
use finstack_core::currency::Currency;
use finstack_monte_carlo::prelude::*;

let engine = McEngine::builder()
    .num_paths(50_000)
    .seed(7)
    .uniform_grid(1.0, 252)
    .parallel(true)
    .build()
    .expect("valid Monte Carlo configuration");

let rng = PhiloxRng::new(7);
let process = GbmProcess::with_params(0.03, 0.01, 0.20)
    .expect("valid GBM parameters");
let disc = ExactGbm::new();
let payoff = EuropeanCall::new(100.0, 1.0, 252);
let discount_factor = (-0.03_f64).exp();

let result = engine
    .price(
        &rng,
        &process,
        &disc,
        &[100.0],
        &payoff,
        Currency::USD,
        discount_factor,
    )
    .expect("pricing should succeed");

println!(
    "price={} stderr={} ci=({}, {}) n={}",
    result.mean,
    result.stderr,
    result.ci_95.0,
    result.ci_95.1,
    result.num_paths
);
```

### Pricing With Captured Paths

Use `price_with_capture()` when you want the aggregate estimate plus a captured
subset of paths for plotting, debugging, cashflow analysis, or downstream data
inspection.

```rust,no_run
use finstack_core::currency::Currency;
use finstack_monte_carlo::prelude::*;

let engine = McEngine::builder()
    .num_paths(10_000)
    .seed(11)
    .uniform_grid(1.0, 12)
    .path_capture(PathCaptureConfig::sample(200, 17).with_payoffs())
    .parallel(false)
    .build()
    .expect("valid Monte Carlo configuration");

let rng = PhiloxRng::new(11);
let process = GbmProcess::with_params(0.03, 0.01, 0.20)
    .expect("valid GBM parameters");
let disc = ExactGbm::new();
let payoff = EuropeanCall::new(100.0, 1.0, 12);
let discount_factor = (-0.03_f64).exp();
let process_params = ProcessParams::new("GBM").with_factors(vec!["spot".to_string()]);

let result = engine
    .price_with_capture(
        &rng,
        &process,
        &disc,
        &[100.0],
        &payoff,
        Currency::USD,
        discount_factor,
        process_params,
    )
    .expect("pricing with capture should succeed");

println!("estimate={}", result.estimate);
println!("captured_paths={}", result.num_captured_paths());

if let Some(paths) = result.paths() {
    println!("sampling={}", paths.sampling_method);
    println!("state_keys={:?}", paths.state_var_keys());
}
```

### Compact GBM-Only Entry Point

If you only need a European-style payoff under GBM dynamics, use
`pricer::european::EuropeanPricer` instead of wiring the generic engine yourself.
It constructs a time grid, `PhiloxRng`, `ExactGbm`, and `McEngine` internally.

## Public Surface

### Engine and runtime configuration

- `engine::McEngine` is the main entry point.
- `engine::McEngineBuilder` provides ergonomic defaults and validation.
- `engine::McEngineConfig` stores the explicit runtime configuration.
- `engine::PathCaptureConfig` and `engine::PathCaptureMode` configure captured
  paths for diagnostics.

### Traits and simulation contracts

- `traits::RandomStream` abstracts RNG implementations and stream splitting.
- `traits::StochasticProcess` defines drift, diffusion, dimensionality, and how
  a raw state vector maps into named path-state fields.
- `traits::Discretization` advances a process by one time step.
- `traits::Payoff` consumes path events and returns an undiscounted `Money`.
- `traits::PathState` exposes named state variables, per-step uniform draws, and
  optional typed cashflows.

### Processes

All process modules are compiled by default:

- `process::gbm`
- `process::brownian`
- `process::gbm_dividends`
- `process::multi_ou`
- `process::correlation`
- `process::metadata`
- `process::heston`
- `process::cir`
- `process::ou`

### Payoffs and pricers

All payoff and pricer modules are compiled by default:

- `payoff::vanilla`
- `payoff::asian`
- `payoff::barrier`
- `payoff::basket`
- `payoff::lookback`
- `pricer::european`
- `pricer::path_dependent`
- `pricer::lsmc`
- `pricer::basis`

### Results and diagnostics

- `results::MoneyEstimate` wraps discounted Monte Carlo estimates in a currency.
- `results::MonteCarloResult` extends the estimate with optional captured paths.
- `paths::{PathDataset, SimulatedPath, PathPoint, ProcessParams}` exposes the
  captured-path data model for diagnostics, cashflow inspection, and visualization.
- `estimate` and `online_stats` contain the raw numeric statistics types used by
  pricing APIs.

### Other supporting modules

- `rng` for pseudo-random and quasi-random generation
- `variance_reduction` for antithetic, control-variate, moment-matching, and
  importance-sampling helpers
- `greeks` for pathwise, LRM, and finite-difference estimators
- `barriers` for Brownian-bridge hit checks and continuity corrections
- `time_grid` for simulation time grids expressed in year fractions
- `seed` for deterministic seed helpers behind `mc`

## Conventions and Units

Unless a specific process or payoff module says otherwise:

- Rates, dividend yields, and volatilities are quoted in decimals, not basis points.
- Time values and time-grid coordinates are year fractions.
- `initial_state` must have length `process.dim()`.
- `Payoff::value()` returns an undiscounted `Money` amount.
- `McEngine::price()` and `price_with_capture()` expect a caller-supplied
  discount factor for the payoff horizon, typically `exp(-rT)` under flat
  continuous compounding.
- Captured `payoff_value` snapshots are stored in the payoff's native amount
  units and are not separately discounted inside each `PathPoint`.
- Captured cashflows use `positive = inflow`, `negative = outflow`.
- Captured percentiles, minima, maxima, and medians are computed from the
  captured subset, not necessarily the full path population.

## Reproducibility and Parallelism

The engine is designed to be reproducible across runs:

- Each Monte Carlo path is mapped to a deterministic substream using
  `rng.split(path_id)`.
- In parallel mode, chunk statistics are reduced deterministically after
  simulation.
- Captured paths are sorted by `path_id` before being returned, so the dataset
  ordering is stable across serial and parallel runs.

Parallel execution has a few important constraints:

- Parallel pricing requires an RNG whose `supports_splitting()` returns `true`.
  `PhiloxRng` is the intended default for this case.
- Sobol / quasi-random generators do not support stream splitting, so they must
  be used in serial mode.
- Rayon-backed parallel execution is compiled in by default, but you can still
  request serial execution per run.
- A `chunk_size` of `1000` means "use the engine's adaptive chunking heuristic".

## Runtime Constraints and Unsupported Combinations

The engine validates several combinations at runtime and returns an error instead
of silently proceeding:

- `num_paths` must be greater than zero.
- `num_paths` must not exceed `MAX_NUM_PATHS` (`10_000_000`).
- `chunk_size` must be greater than zero.
- `discount_factor` must be finite and non-negative.
- `target_ci_half_width` must be finite and positive if supplied.
- `target_ci_half_width` is currently supported only in serial mode.
- Path capture cannot be combined with `antithetic = true`.
- Sampled path capture requires `1 <= count <= num_paths`.

For sampled capture, the sample size is deterministic but approximate:
`PathCaptureMode::Sample { count, seed }` uses deterministic Bernoulli sampling,
so the realized number of retained paths is generally close to `count` rather
than guaranteed to equal it exactly.

## Results and Captured Diagnostics

`MoneyEstimate` contains:

- `mean`
- `stderr`
- `ci_95`
- `num_paths`
- optional `std_dev`
- optional `median`, `percentile_25`, `percentile_75`, `min`, and `max`

`MonteCarloResult` adds an optional `PathDataset`. A captured dataset can
contain:

- the full captured subset of `SimulatedPath` values
- the total number of simulated paths
- the sampling method used to retain paths
- process metadata describing how to interpret raw state vectors

Each `SimulatedPath` can contain:

- `PathPoint` entries for every captured time step
- per-step raw state vectors
- typed cashflows emitted by the payoff
- optional per-step payoff snapshots
- final discounted path value
- optional IRR inferred from captured cashflows when available

If you supply `ProcessParams::with_factors(...)`, downstream consumers can call
`PathDataset::state_var_keys()` to recover stable names for each state-vector
position.

## Extending the Crate

The crate is intended to be extended via traits rather than by modifying the
engine loop directly.

### Implement a new process

Implement `StochasticProcess` when you want a new model family. In particular:

- `dim()` defines the raw state-vector length
- `num_factors()` defines the number of independent shocks
- `drift()` and `diffusion()` define the SDE
- `populate_path_state()` maps raw state entries into semantic keys such as
  `spot`, `variance`, or `short_rate`

That last step is important because payoffs should read named values from
`PathState` instead of assuming a raw state layout.

### Implement a new discretization

Implement `Discretization<P>` when you want a new stepping scheme. Prefer exact
schemes when an analytical transition is available, and otherwise document the
stability and positivity assumptions of the approximation.

### Implement a new payoff

Implement `Payoff` when you want a custom contract or event-driven path logic:

- use `on_path_start()` for per-path random setup
- use `on_event()` to consume each path state
- use `state.add_cashflow()` or `state.add_typed_cashflow()` when the payoff
  should emit diagnostic cashflows
- use `value()` to return the final undiscounted payoff amount
- use `reset()` to clear all per-path state before the next simulation

## Build, Test, and Document

From the workspace root:

```bash
cargo test -p finstack-monte-carlo
cargo test -p finstack-monte-carlo -- --ignored
cargo doc -p finstack-monte-carlo --no-deps
```

If you are consuming the crate from another workspace member, prefer importing
through `finstack_monte_carlo::prelude::*` in examples and prototypes, and then
switch to explicit module paths where you want a narrower public surface.
