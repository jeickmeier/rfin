//! Barrier-monitoring helpers for Monte Carlo pricing.
//!
//! These modules are used by barrier payoffs and other first-passage-style
//! diagnostics. [`bridge`] models continuous barrier hits between monitoring
//! dates, while [`corrections`] provides continuity adjustments that reduce the
//! bias of discretely monitored simulations.
