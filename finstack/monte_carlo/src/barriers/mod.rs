//! Barrier-monitoring helpers for Monte Carlo pricing.
//!
//! These modules are used by barrier payoffs and other first-passage-style
//! diagnostics (available with the `mc` feature). `bridge` models continuous
//! barrier hits between monitoring dates, while `corrections` provides
//! continuity adjustments that reduce the bias of discretely monitored
//! simulations.
