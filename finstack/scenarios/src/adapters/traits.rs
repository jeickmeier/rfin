//! Engine-internal effect enum produced by adapter functions.
//!
//! Adapter modules expose free functions that translate an [`crate::spec::OperationSpec`]
//! into a [`Vec<ScenarioEffect>`]. The engine's centralized `match` in
//! [`crate::engine::ScenarioEngine::apply`] dispatches each operation variant
//! to the appropriate adapter function and then collapses the resulting
//! effects against the mutable [`crate::engine::ExecutionContext`].
//!
//! This module no longer defines a polymorphic `ScenarioAdapter` trait — the
//! enum dispatch in the engine provides compile-time exhaustiveness over the
//! [`crate::spec::OperationSpec`] variants and avoids the silent "operation not supported"
//! warning the previous trait-based dispatch produced.
