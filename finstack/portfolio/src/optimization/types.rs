// ── Numerical tolerances ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The optimizer mixes several different scales (raw quantities, notionals,
// base-currency PVs, fractional weights, constraint slacks) in the same LP.
// Picking a single tolerance for all of them is wrong — a 1e-9 weight is
// genuinely negligible, while a 1e-9 base-currency-PV may not be. The
// constants below name each tolerance by what it gates, so future changes
// are easier to reason about and harder to miss.
//
// # Conventions
//
// - **`PV_PER_UNIT_TOL`**: smallest `|pv_per_unit|` we will divide by when
//   reconstructing implied quantities under `ValueWeight`. Below this we
//   either reject the candidate (decision-space) or set the implied
//   quantity to zero (LP solver) — see the call sites for which.
// - **`MIN_WEIGHT_TOL`**: smallest `|min_weight|` that we treat as
//   "non-zero" when classifying candidates as long-only or
//   long-short-eligible.
// - **`GROSS_BASE_TOL`**: smallest gross base-currency / notional value
//   below which weight normalization collapses to zero (avoids divide-by-
//   zero on hedged-flat books).
// - **`WEIGHT_TOL`**: smallest absolute weight we treat as a real position
//   when filtering the trade list output.
// - **`SLACK_TOL`**: smallest absolute constraint slack at which a
//   constraint is reported as binding in the result envelope.
//
// These are deliberately *not* a single global tolerance. The PV scale
// (`PV_PER_UNIT_TOL = 1e-12`) and the weight scale (`WEIGHT_TOL = 1e-9`)
// and the constraint-slack scale (`SLACK_TOL = 1e-6`) all live at
// different orders of magnitude because the quantities they gate live at
// different orders of magnitude.
