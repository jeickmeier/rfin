//! Market data infrastructure for financial instrument pricing.
//!
//! This module provides the core market data types and containers used by
//! pricing engines throughout Finstack. It includes yield curves, credit curves,
//! volatility surfaces, and the `MarketContext` that aggregates them for
//! valuation workflows.
//!
//! # Market Data Types
//!
//! ## Term Structures (1D Curves)
//!
//! - **Discount curves** (`DiscountCurve`): Risk-free rates for discounting
//! - **Forward curves** (`ForwardCurve`): Expected future interest rates
//! - **Hazard curves** (`HazardCurve`): Credit default intensities
//! - **Inflation curves** (`InflationCurve`): CPI expectations
//!
//! ## Surfaces (2D)
//!
//! - **Volatility surfaces** (`VolSurface`): Implied volatility by strike/maturity
//!
//! ## Scalars and Time Series
//!
//! - **Market scalars** (`MarketScalar`): Spot prices, FX rates, indices
//! - **Inflation indices** (`InflationIndex`): CPI/RPI time series
//!
//! # Market Context
//!
//! `MarketContext` aggregates all market data needed for a valuation run:
//! - Stores curves by ID with type-safe retrieval
//! - Provides FX conversion via [`crate::money::fx::FxMatrix`]
//! - Supports scenario bumps and stress testing
//! - Thread-safe for parallel pricing
//!
//! # Industry Standards
//!
//! Market data handling follows conventions from:
//! - **ISDA** for day-count, business-day, and credit-market terminology
//! - **Andersen / Piterbarg** for modern term-structure construction context
//! - **Gatheral** and standard practitioner texts for volatility-surface
//!   interpretation
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use finstack_core::market_data::{context::MarketContext, term_structures::DiscountCurve};
//! use time::macros::date;
//!
//! let base = date!(2025 - 01 - 01);
//!
//! // Build a discount curve
//! let curve = DiscountCurve::builder("USD-OIS")
//!     .base_date(base)
//!     .knots([(0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.95), (5.0, 0.78)])
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! // Add to market context
//! let market = MarketContext::new().insert(curve);
//! assert!(market.get_discount("USD-OIS").is_ok());
//! # Ok::<(), finstack_core::Error>(())
//! ```
