//! Holiday calendar system for financial markets.
//!
//! Provides deterministic, high-performance holiday calendars for scheduling
//! cashflows, adjusting payment dates, and validating business days across
//! global financial markets.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **100+ market calendars**: Major exchanges, central banks, and settlement systems
//! - **Rule-based definitions**: JSON-defined rules for transparency and auditability
//! - **Bitset optimization**: O(1) lookup for years 1970-2150
//! - **Composite calendars**: Combine multiple calendars for multi-currency schedules
//! - **Business day adjustments**: Following, Modified Following, Preceding conventions
//! - **Zero allocation**: Calendar lookups use stack memory only
//!
//! # Supported Date Range
//!
//! Holiday calendars are optimized for years **1970-2150** using pre-computed
//! bitsets. Years outside this range fall back to runtime rule evaluation
//! (slower but still correct).
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//!
//! ## Holiday vs. Business Day
//!
//! - **Holiday**: Non-working date as defined by a specific market calendar
//!   (e.g., Christmas, Lunar New Year, bank holidays)
//! - **Business day**: Any day that is not a weekend (Saturday/Sunday) AND not
//!   a market-specific holiday
//!
//! Many calendars include weekends in their holiday definitions for convenience,
//! while others intentionally omit them. Regardless, [`HolidayCalendar::is_business_day`]
//! always treats Saturday/Sunday as non-business days.
//!
//! **Guideline**: Use `is_business_day` for scheduling and date adjustments.
//! Use `is_holiday` only when you need market-specific holiday information.
//!
//! # Quick Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use finstack_core::dates::{adjust, BusinessDayConvention, HolidayCalendar};
//! use finstack_core::dates::calendar::registry::CalendarRegistry;
//! use time::{Date, Month};
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!
//! // Get New York Stock Exchange calendar
//! let nyse = CalendarRegistry::global()
//!     .resolve_str("nyse")
//!     .ok_or("NYSE calendar not found")?;
//!
//! // Check if a date is a business day
//! let date = Date::from_calendar_date(2025, Month::December, 25)?;
//! assert!(!nyse.is_business_day(date)); // Christmas is not a business day
//!
//! // Adjust date to next business day
//! let adjusted = adjust(date, BusinessDayConvention::Following, nyse)?;
//! assert_eq!(adjusted, Date::from_calendar_date(2025, Month::December, 26)?);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! - [`rule`]: Rule-based holiday definitions (Easter, IMM, lunar calendars)
//! - [`registry`]: Calendar registration and lookup system
//! - [`business_days`]: Business day adjustment and counting
//! - [`composite`]: Multi-calendar union support
//! - [`generated`]: Build-time generated bitsets for performance

//! - `get_calendar` for calendar lookup by name
//! - `BusinessDayConvention` for adjustment conventions
//! - `CompositeCalendar` for combining calendars
