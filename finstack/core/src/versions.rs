//! Canonical model-version strings for audit trails and calibration reports.
//!
//! # Why centralize
//!
//! Each calibration target previously emitted its own hard-coded
//! model-version string into [`CalibrationReport::model_version`], so
//! any version bump touched several unrelated files and the strings
//! were visible only to reviewers who happened to grep for them.
//!
//! Centralizing them here means:
//!
//! * A reviewer can see the full set of active model versions at a glance
//!   when auditing the calibration pipeline.
//! * A version bump touches one file.
//! * Consumers that persist the `model_version` field to audit logs see
//!   consistent, drift-free identifiers regardless of which entry point
//!   produced the report.
//!
//! # Naming convention
//!
//! Each constant follows the pattern:
//!
//! ```text
//! <ModelName> v<semver> [(implementation notes in parentheses)]
//! ```
//!
//! where `<semver>` is a conceptual version tracking the calibration
//! methodology (not the crate version), and the parenthetical notes call
//! out non-default algorithm choices (e.g. "Jamshidian decomposition,
//! vega-weighted, multi-start"). Bump the version whenever a change to
//! the calibration math would plausibly move prices under otherwise
//! identical inputs.

/// Hull-White 1F calibration (Jamshidian decomposition, vega-weighted
/// residuals, Halton multi-start).
pub const HULL_WHITE_1F: &str =
    "Hull-White 1F (Jamshidian decomposition, vega-weighted, multi-start)";

/// Multi-curve OIS discount curve bootstrap, produced by the default
/// target at `finstack_valuations::calibration::targets::discount`.

/// parameterization, runtime-generated Gauss-Laguerre quadrature).
pub const STUDENT_T_COPULA: &str = "Student-t Copula Calibration v1.0";

/// SVI volatility surface calibration with Gatheral total-variance
/// interpolation across expiries. The "v1.1" bump distinguishes this
/// interpolation from the earlier parameter-space linear interpolation
/// which admitted calendar-spread arbitrage.
