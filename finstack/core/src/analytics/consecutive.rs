//! Consecutive streak counter for return series analysis.
//!
//! Used by the aggregation module to compute the longest win and loss streaks
//! from period-level return sequences.

/// Count maximum consecutive runs where `predicate` holds.
///
/// Scans `values` left-to-right and returns the length of the longest
/// unbroken streak of elements for which `predicate` returns `true`.
/// Typical usage: longest run of positive returns (wins) or negative
/// returns (losses) in a period-aggregated return series.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `values` - Slice of return values to scan.
/// * `predicate` - Closure returning `true` for elements that count as a "hit".
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Length of the longest consecutive streak. Returns `0` if `values` is
/// empty or no element satisfies the predicate.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use finstack_core::analytics::consecutive::count_consecutive;
///
/// // One losing period followed by three wins → longest streak is 3.
/// let returns = [-0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04];
/// assert_eq!(count_consecutive(&returns, |v| v > 0.0), 3);
///
/// // Empty slice always returns 0.
/// assert_eq!(count_consecutive(&[], |v: f64| v > 0.0), 0);
/// ```
