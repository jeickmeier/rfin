# Finstack Core Benchmarks

This directory contains Criterion benchmark suites for `finstack-core`.

The benchmark sources are the ground truth. This README explains what is
measured and how to run the suites. It intentionally avoids hard latency,
allocation, or "all targets met" claims unless you have current benchmark
results to back them up.

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all core benchmarks
cargo bench --package finstack-core

# Run selected suites
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench money_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench daycount_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench calendar_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench interpolation
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench curve_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench expr_dag
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench rolling
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench solver_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench market_context
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench vol_surface
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench integration
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench statistical_functions
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench rate_conversions
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench cashflow_operations
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench schedule_generation
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench factor_model

# Compile benchmark targets without running them
cargo bench --package finstack-core --bench expr_dag --bench market_context --no-run

# Save and compare Criterion baselines
cargo bench --package finstack-core -- --save-baseline baseline_name
cargo bench --package finstack-core -- --baseline baseline_name
```

## Reading Results

Criterion writes results under `target/criterion/`. Useful outputs include:

- Terminal summaries with confidence intervals
- HTML reports in `target/criterion/*/report/index.html`
- Raw measurement data under each benchmark directory

## Evidence Standard

Use current benchmark output, not this README, to make performance claims.

Recommended workflow:
1. Compile touched benchmark targets with `--no-run` during refactoring.
2. Run the relevant suites on the current branch.
3. Save a baseline before larger changes.
4. Compare against that baseline after the change.
5. Record any release-note or README performance claims only after those results exist.

## Notes

- Benchmarks run under Cargo's benchmark profile.
- Results vary by hardware, toolchain, thermal state, and background load.
- `black_box()` is used to reduce optimizer distortion.
- If you add a new benchmark suite, update this README with what it measures, not with guessed numbers or stale target values.
