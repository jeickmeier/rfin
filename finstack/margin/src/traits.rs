/// Trait for instruments that support margin calculations.
///
/// This is a standalone trait so `finstack-margin` has no dependency on
/// `finstack-valuations`. Concrete implementations live in valuations as a
/// bridge layer.
///
/// # Conventions
///
/// - [`Self::mtm_for_vm`] returns the current mark-to-market in instrument or
///   reporting currency units, not basis points.
/// - [`Self::simm_sensitivities`] must return sensitivities in the units
///   documented by [`crate::SimmSensitivities`], especially for DV01/CS01-style
///   inputs where decimal-vs-basis-point mistakes materially change IM.
pub trait Marginable: Send + Sync {
    /// Get the instrument's unique identifier.
    fn id(&self) -> &str;

    /// Get the OTC margin specification for this instrument.
    fn margin_spec(&self) -> Option<&OtcMarginSpec>;

    /// Get the repo margin specification for this instrument.
    ///
    /// Default implementation returns `None`. Override for repo instruments.

        None
    }

    /// Get the netting set identifier for margin aggregation.
    fn netting_set_id(&self) -> Option<NettingSetId>;

    /// Calculate SIMM sensitivities for this instrument.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `market` - Market data used to produce the sensitivities
    /// * `as_of` - Valuation date for the sensitivity snapshot
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A [`SimmSensitivities`] value whose buckets use the conventions in
    /// [`crate::SimmSensitivities`]. In particular, delta and vega values should
    /// already be expressed in currency amounts per the SIMM risk measure being
    /// populated rather than raw quote moves.
    ///
    /// This method **always** performs a full recompute from the supplied
    /// market state. For scenario sweeps where only a subset of curves
    /// have moved, prefer [`Self::simm_sensitivities_incremental`], which
    /// lets implementations reuse a previously-computed baseline.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error when the instrument cannot produce a consistent SIMM
    /// sensitivity set for the requested market state.

    /// Compute SIMM sensitivities with opportunistic reuse of a prior
    /// snapshot when only a subset of market curves have changed.
    ///
    /// This is the hook aggregators use when running scenario sweeps: they
    /// pass the sensitivities from the previous scenario in `prior` plus
    /// the list of curve IDs that the current scenario has mutated in
    /// `dirty_curve_ids`. Instruments that can cheaply detect "my
    /// sensitivities don't depend on any of those curves" can return
    /// `prior.clone()` without rerunning the full pricing path; others
    /// can do a partial recompute.
    ///
    /// # Default behavior
    ///
    /// The default implementation ignores `prior` and `dirty_curve_ids`
    /// and performs a full recompute by delegating to
    /// [`Self::simm_sensitivities`]. This is correct for every instrument
    /// but gives up the optimization. Override in implementations where
    /// full-recompute cost dominates scenario-sweep runtime.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `prior` - Previously-computed sensitivities from an adjacent
    ///   scenario, or `None` for a cold start.
    /// * `dirty_curve_ids` - Curve IDs that have changed since `prior`
    ///   was computed. Empty means "nothing changed since prior" — a
    ///   correct incremental impl may return `prior.cloned()` there.
    /// * `market` - Current market state.
    /// * `as_of` - Valuation date.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Same as [`Self::simm_sensitivities`].
