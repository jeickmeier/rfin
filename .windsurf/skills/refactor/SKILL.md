name: refactor
description: Improve existing code structure without changing externally observable behavior. Use when Codex needs to refactor, clean up, simplify, reduce complexity, extract helpers or modules, rename symbols, reduce duplication, tighten types or invariants, split large functions or files, or make existing code easier and safer to extend without rewriting from scratch.

# Refactor

## Goal

Preserve behavior while making the next change cheaper, safer, and easier to reason about. Prefer the smallest structural change that materially improves local clarity, ownership, or extension cost.

## Load references selectively

Do not load every reference by default. Open only the file that matches the current refactor.

- `references/repo-refactor-boundaries.md`: open when deciding whether code belongs in Rust core crates, bindings, stubs, exports, or parity surfaces.
- `references/rust-refactor-heuristics.md`: open when refactoring Rust internals or choosing between helpers, structs, enums, params structs, modules, or traits.
- `references/binding-layer-patterns.md`: open when touching `finstack-py` binding code, Python-facing API shape, registration, or error mapping.
- `references/refactor-sync-checklist.md`: open before finishing a refactor that changes public APIs, exports, module layout, names, or cross-language surfaces.
- `references/repo-examples.md`: open when you want a repo-shaped example before choosing the operation.

## Operating rules

- Separate refactoring from feature work. If the user asks for both, identify the minimal structural change that unlocks the feature and avoid opportunistic cleanup outside that boundary.
- Preserve public behavior unless the user explicitly asks for behavioral changes. Treat outputs, error semantics, side effects, ordering, and performance expectations as invariants.
- Keep public APIs stable unless there is a clear user-approved reason to change them.
- Stay within the existing architecture and style unless the current pattern is the problem.
- Prefer deletion over abstraction. Add helpers, types, traits, or layers only when they remove real duplication or clarify ownership.
- Define the exact change boundary before editing: files, functions, callers, invariants, and follow-on surfaces such as docs, bindings, or stubs.
- Reduce scope when behavior is unclear and there is no reliable way to validate the change.

## Refactoring workflow

1. Audit the target.
   - Identify the real pain: duplication, oversized functions, naming drift, mixed responsibilities, hidden invariants, brittle control flow, type misuse, or dead paths.
   - State what must not change.
   - Choose the smallest viable scope.
2. Choose the operation.
   - Extract function, type, or module.
   - Inline a useless wrapper or indirection layer.
   - Rename toward domain language.
   - Introduce a small parameter or result struct when the data is cohesive.
   - Move behavior to the type or module that owns the data.
   - Replace primitive state with an enum, newtype, or domain type when it enforces a real invariant.
   - Flatten control flow with guard clauses or a clearer dispatch mechanism.
   - Collapse duplicate pathways into one canonical path.
   - Remove dead code once ownership and callers are understood.
3. Implement mechanically.
   - Make the change easy to review.
   - Change one conceptual thing at a time.
   - Preserve call order, side effects, allocation and borrowing behavior, and error mapping.
   - Avoid style churn unrelated to the refactor.
   - Update comments, docs, exports, and stubs only where the structure actually changed.
4. Finish cleanly.
   - Summarize the structural improvement.
   - Name the invariants you preserved.
   - Call out residual risk such as unvalidated paths, wide call surfaces, or performance-sensitive code.

## Smell-to-operation guide

- Long function: extract coherent blocks by responsibility; name helpers by intent, not implementation detail.
- Duplication: unify the business rule first, then share the mechanism; do not force near-duplicates together if they are diverging for legitimate reasons.
- Large module: split by responsibility and dependency direction; avoid creating a generic `utils` dump.
- Long parameter list: introduce a small struct only for cohesive data; do not hide unrelated arguments in a bag type.
- Naming drift: rename toward established domain language and match adjacent modules.
- Primitive obsession: introduce a domain type only when it clarifies meaning or enforces an invariant used in multiple places.
- Nested branching: prefer guard clauses, focused validation helpers, or a simple dispatch table; do not reach for polymorphism by default.
- Indirection overload: inline wrappers that add no policy, safety, or reuse value.
- Dead code: remove it once live callers are understood; use `dead-code-removal` instead of broad manual sweeps.
- API surface bloat: converge on one obvious path and remove wrappers when the user scope allows it.

## Pattern selection rules

- Prefer extraction before introducing new abstractions.
- Prefer a plain function or small private helper over a new class, trait, or strategy object.
- Prefer a struct or enum when it makes invalid states harder to represent.
- Prefer explicit data flow over hidden mutation.
- Prefer moving logic to the layer that owns the invariant, not the layer that happens to call it.
- Prefer local simplification over architectural rewrites.

## Repo-specific constraints

- Keep business and valuation logic in the Rust core crates. Keep Python and WASM bindings thin: conversion, wrapper construction, registration, and error mapping only.
- Maintain parity across Rust, Python, and WASM surfaces when refactoring shared API shape.
- Keep manually maintained `.pyi` stubs in sync when binding signatures, names, or exports change.
- Respect Python binding module conventions: `register()`, `__all__`, `__doc__`, wrapper types with `inner`, and centralized error conversion.
- Follow existing API conventions such as `get_*` accessors, builder chaining, and established metric-key formats.
- In Rust, prefer small private helpers or focused structs over macro-heavy or pattern-heavy abstractions.
- Do not introduce `unwrap`, `expect`, or panic-based flows into non-test binding code.

## Do not do these things

- Do not rewrite from scratch when a surgical change is enough.
- Do not mix refactoring with unrelated feature work.
- Do not add framework-like abstractions to future-proof simple code.
- Do not replace straightforward conditionals with polymorphism unless the branching complexity truly justifies it.
- Do not split code into many tiny helpers that hide the main flow.
- Do not move logic across architectural boundaries unless the boundary itself is the problem.
- Do not claim a behavioral refactor when semantics changed; say so explicitly.

## Coordinate with adjacent skills when needed

- Use `simplicity-auditor` when the primary goal is converging multiple pathways into one obvious path.
- Use `consistency-reviewer` when the main problem is cross-module naming or pattern drift.
- Use `dead-code-removal` when the task is broad unused-code cleanup.
- Use `documentation-reviewer` when the refactor changes public APIs, docs, or stub surfaces significantly.

## Output expectations

When using this skill, report:

- the exact refactor target
- the invariant or behavior being preserved
- the structural operations chosen
- the files or surfaces that must stay in sync
- any recommended validation the user may want to run
